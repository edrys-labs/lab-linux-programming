Suppose we accidentally misspell the `printf` function.\n\n1. **Modify your program** again:\n\n   ```c\n   #include <stdio.h>\n\n   int main() {\n      char name[50];\n\n      printf(\"Enter your name: \");\n      scanf(\"%s\", name)\n      // Error: 'print' is used instead of 'printf'\n      print(\"Hello, %s!\\n\", name);\n\n      return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Try to compile it again with.\n\n### Identifying and Fixing the Error\n\nWhen you try to compile this incorrect program, GCC will generate an error message. Here's what you might see in your terminal:\n\n``` bash\nmain.c:7:21: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘print’\n  7 |    scanf(\"%s\", name)\n    |                     ^\n    |                     ;\n  8 |    // Error: 'print' is used instead of 'printf'\n  9 |    print(\"Hello, %s!\\n\", name);\n    |    ~~~~~ \n```\n\n**What went wrong?**\n\n- **Implicit declaration of function ‘print’**: This means GCC doesn't recognize `print` as a valid function. This is because there is no standard function called `print` in C; it should be `printf`.\n- **Expected ‘;’ before ‘(’ token**: This error appears because GCC is confused by the unexpected function name and mishandles the syntax of C.\n\n**How to fix it:**\n\n- Replace `print` with `printf`.\n- Make sure every function call ends with a semicolon (`;`).\n\nAfter correcting the error, save your file and compile it again. When you run it, it should work as expected, asking for your name and greeting you correctly.\n\nThis process of identifying errors from compiler messages and resolving them is crucial in learning to program in C or any programming language.\n ",
